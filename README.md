# Project Euler in Scala

I've always wanted to go deep into the Project Euler problems, both because it will make me a better programmer, and improve my problem-solving skills. Going through the problems, particularly with a language like Scala, can really boost your understanding of the collections library, your use of pattern-matching, your 'functional' approaches to new problems, etc., as well as help you brush up on your number theory, dynamic programming, and it's just fun.

Whenever I feel like tackling a new problem, I'll try to post my best solution here. I'll also edit a solution if I find a better, more succint or 'Scala'-like way of expressing the answer. You can friend me with the key ```19176862301052_5c938324d4a42ad288e91aa8b50f7ca8```
